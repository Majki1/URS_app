      "* **SP (Stack Pointer):** Points to the top of the stack where temporary data, local variables, and return addresses are stored. The stack typically grows downward, and each push operation decreases the SP value. This register is essential for managing function call contexts and local storage.",
      "",
      "* **LR (Link Register):** Holds the return address when a subroutine is called. When a `BL` (Branch with Link) instruction is executed, the address of the instruction immediately following the call is automatically stored in LR. This mechanism allows the processor to know where to resume execution once the subroutine has finished. In cases of nested subroutine calls, it is common practice to save LR on the stack to preserve the correct return address.",

      "  - Flash memory is non-volatile, meaning that it retains its content without power.",

      "  - Typically, code is organized into sections (such as text, data, and read-only data) according to the linker script.",

      "",
      "```c",
      "int counter;            // Global variable stored in SRAM",

      "",
      "### Detailed Explanation",
      "- **Automatic Storage of Return Address:**",
      "  - On entering an interrupt service routine (ISR), the LR is loaded with a special value known as an exception return code (often referred to as `EXC_RETURN`). This value indicates not only the return address but also which stack pointer was in use (MSP or PSP) and whether floating-point state was saved.",
      "",
      "- **Resuming Execution:**",

      "- **Handling Nested Interrupts:**",
      "  - In systems with nested interrupts, additional care must be taken. If an interrupt handler calls another subroutine or if multiple interrupts occur, LR may be overwritten. To prevent this, the handler often saves LR on the stack at the beginning of the routine and restores it before returning.",
